TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

Had Quiz this week. Quiz was definitely not too difficult, however the only question that seemed to bug me was the most common letter in animal names. However, since I had quite a bit of time left, I was able to solve that. 

Since most of the time was spent on the quiz, I had no time to continue on Data Project.
